### Code Quality Rubric

- Use JSX to create components.
- Talk with your instructor to commit to either using class based components to manage state _or_ using hooks. You should not use both.
- Use `create-react-app` to build a React app.
- Use `fetch` to make API calls.
- Use `react-router-dom` to create different views.
- Use `youtube-react` to create a Youtube component for viewing videos from the Youtube API.
- Respond to user input to make an API call to the YouTube API.
- Use state to build a stateful React application.
- Use CSS to make a responsive and attractive app with decent interface.
